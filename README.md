-= ASSEMBLY 4 AI PROJECT ARORA =-

Project for running neural networks in a pure built from scratch assembly environment.

Rulez:

- no existing sys calls
- no interrupts
- no foreign code
- tweaked opcode usage

these rulez apply only for running the neural network itself.

This is just a basic summary full file readme.md later.

Yours sincerely,
